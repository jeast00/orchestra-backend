# README

Welcome to the Orchestra!
This application allows you to create a band name and add instruments that will play music! You will be able to edit your band name, delete your band and create a new one.
Instructions -
This application has a backend Ruby on Rails API and a frontend Javascript. Frontend Javascript file can be found here - https://github.com/jeast00/orchestra-frontend
After cloning and setting up your IDE with these folders, ensure you run 'bundle install' in the terminal.
The Javascript frontend index.html file can be opened in the terminal by typing 'open index.html'.
After opening the index.html file, proceed to create a band name.
After creating a band name, you will be able to add a variety of different instruments to your band. Each instrument will be able to play sounds and musical melodies.
Development:
There was no local testing for this application. This application was built from the ground up and tested within the terminal to ensure the code was properly working. This application was built from the ground up with the help of countless hours of google searching, the inspiration of learning to code with Flatiron School, and the never ending support from students and staff.
